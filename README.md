# AndroidMyoService-for-Unity
Service for Android devices which allows you to forward Myo events to Unity

# Summary
The Service was build in Android Studio and is used for the Unity Plugin in the other repositories.
I uploaded the whole project, just in case somebody wants to modify the service.
The main logic is implemented in the three classes in the java source folder. The dependencies you need, myo and unity libs, are also included.
